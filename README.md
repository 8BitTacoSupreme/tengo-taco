Tengo Taco üåÆ

Tengo Taco is a simple and powerful web application that helps you find the perfect taco recipe based on the ingredients you have on hand. It fetches recipes from the Edamam API, displays them in a clean user interface, and provides a direct link to get the ingredients delivered via Instacart.

This project is built as a prototype using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and a Node.js/Express backend that acts as a secure proxy to handle API requests.
Features

    Ingredient-Based Search: Enter an ingredient (e.g., "shrimp", "chicken") to find relevant taco recipes.

    Smart Fallback: If no taco-specific recipes are found, the app automatically broadens the search to find any recipe with your ingredient.

    Recipe Details Modal: Click on any recipe card to view a pop-up with the full ingredient list and a link to the original cooking instructions.

    Instacart Integration: With a single click, generate a shopping list and open a pre-populated Instacart cart in a new tab.

    Secure Backend Proxy: Protects your API keys by keeping them on the server, never exposing them to the user's browser.

    Reproducible Environment: Uses Flox to ensure the correct Node.js environment is used for the backend, making setup a breeze.

Tech Stack

    Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript

    Backend: Node.js, Express.js

    Dependencies: node-fetch, cors

    Environment Management: Flox

üöÄ Setup and Installation

To get this project running locally, follow these steps.
Prerequisites

    Node.js: You must have Node.js installed. You can download it from nodejs.org.

    Flox: You must have the Flox CLI installed. You can find installation instructions at flox.dev.

    Edamam API Key: You need a valid Application ID and Application Key from the Edamam Developer Portal with access to the Recipe Search API v2.

1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the project to your local machine:

git clone [https://github.com/8BitTacoSupreme/tengo-taco.git](https://github.com/8BitTacoSupreme/tengo-taco.git)
cd tengo-taco

2. Configure Your API Keys

This is the most important step. Your private API credentials must be added to the backend server.

    Navigate to the backend directory: cd tengo-taco-backend

    Open the server.js file in a text editor.

    Find the following lines at the top of the file:

    const EDAMAM_APP_ID = 'YOUR_APP_ID';
    const EDAMAM_API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY';

    Replace the placeholder values with your actual Edamam Application ID and Application Key.

3. Install Backend Dependencies

Now, we'll install the Node.js packages required for the server.

    Make sure you are still inside the tengo-taco-backend directory.

    Run the following command:

    npm install

    This will read your package.json file and install express, cors, and node-fetch.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

The application has two parts that must be running simultaneously.
1. Start the Backend Server

The backend server must be running to handle API calls.

    Navigate to the tengo-taco-backend directory.

    Activate the Flox environment:

    flox activate

    Start the server:

    node server.js

    You should see a confirmation message in your terminal: Tengo Taco proxy server running on http://localhost:3001

    Leave this terminal window open.

2. Run the Frontend

    While the server is running, navigate to the root tengo-taco folder.

    Open the index.html file in your favorite web browser.

You can now use the application!
